###About
I am a second year graduate student at Columbia University, working towards my MPH in Infectious Disease Epidemiology.  I also work as an intern in the Zoonotic, Influenza, and Vector Borne Disease Unit at the New York City Department of Health.

Formerly, I received a B.A. in history and economics from Brown University in 2009.  I am a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer, having served in Guyana from 2015-2017.  I also worked for the Office of Minority Health at the Rhode Island Department of Health.  

I am currently taking Data Science, and created this [dashboard](flex_dashboard.html) as part of my homework assignment.
